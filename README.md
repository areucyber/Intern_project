Comprehensive Threat Intelligence Platform

Project Overview:
This project aims to design and implement a robust Threat Intelligence Platform that automates the collection, analysis, and visualization of cybersecurity threat data. By integrating data from multiple threat intelligence sources—AlienVault OTX, VirusTotal, and Shodan APIs—the platform provides real-time insights into malicious activities. It further enhances detection capabilities by utilizing machine learning models for identifying patterns in network traffic, offering security professionals valuable threat intelligence for proactive defense.

Key Objectives:

Data Collection & Integration: Seamlessly gather threat data from AlienVault OTX, VirusTotal, and Shodan APIs.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and structure network traffic data, extracting key features like IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
Threat Detection: Apply machine learning models to detect and classify malicious traffic patterns.
Visualization & Reporting: Build an interactive dashboard for real-time threat monitoring and automate intelligence reporting.
Dataset Utilized:

CIC-IDS Dataset: Provides labeled datasets of network traffic with detailed normal and attack behavior, supporting accurate machine learning classification.
